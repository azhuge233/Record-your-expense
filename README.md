## Dependences

-   Flask 1.0.2 [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

## CSS

Amazing opensource NES-style css framework from [NES.css](https://github.com/BcRikko/NES.css) by [ダーシノBcRikko](https://github.com/BcRikko)

## Usage

Simply run  

```shell
python run.py
```

in the directory. The website will run at localhost:2323 by default.

## Things you should modify

-   To modify the port, change the PORT variable in run.py file.
-   To modify the login username and password, you should change the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables in run.py. The username is “admin” and the password is empty by default.
-   I wrote this on Windows, if it’s Linux, you should change the two PATH variable in the json-op.py file.

## Other things

This is just a simple page that satisfy my personal needs. Maybe I’ll add more functions in the future.
