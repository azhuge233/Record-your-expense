## CSS

Amazing opensource NES-style css framework from [NES.css](https://github.com/BcRikko/NES.css) by [ダーシノBcRikko](https://github.com/BcRikko)

## Usage

Simply run  

```shell
python run.py
```

in the directory. The website will run at localhost:2323 by default.

To modify the port, change the PORT variable in run.py file.

I wrote this on Windows, if it’s Linux, you should change two PATH variable in the json-op.py file.

## Other things

This is just a simple page that satisfy my personal needs. Maybe I’ll add more functions in the future.
